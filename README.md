- Follow tutorials and official docs  
- Build small hands-on examples  
- Organize and version my learning  
- Experiment with UI-driven prompt generation  
- Explore conversational flows and message placeholders

ðŸ“Œ Notes
    These scripts are minimal examples meant to isolate and understand each feature.

    Some files may overlap or experiment with the same concept in different ways.

    prompts_ui.py lets you test prompts interactively using Streamlit with different styles & lengths.

    chat_prompt_template.py and message_placeholder.py demonstrate how to use message placeholders for injecting conversation history.

    chatbot.py explores a simple chatbot workflow using LangChainâ€™s messaging utilities
