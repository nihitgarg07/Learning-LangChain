# LangChain Models â€“ Learning Snippets

This repository contains small, focused code snippets and experiments for learning and practicing **LangChain** concepts, including:

- ðŸ”¹ Chat Models (OpenAI, Hugging Face)  
- ðŸ”¹ Embedding Models (OpenAI, Local)  
- ðŸ”¹ LLMs and Prompt Interaction  
- ðŸ”¹ Prompt Templates (JSON-driven)  
- ðŸ”¹ Streamlit UI for Prompt Testing  

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This repo is part of my **LangChain learning journey**, where I:

- Follow tutorials and official docs  
- Build small hands-on examples  
- Organize and version my learning  
- Experiment with UI-driven prompt generation

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-models-learning.git
   cd langchain-models-learning

2. Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set your environment variables in .env

    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
    HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_hf_token

4. Run a script

    python ChatModels/chatmodel_openai.py

5. Run the Streamlit UI

    streamlit run prompts/prompts_ui.py


ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
    LangChain

    OpenAI

    Hugging Face

    Streamlit

    Python

ðŸ“Œ Notes
    These scripts are minimal examples meant to isolate and understand each feature.

    Some files may overlap or experiment with the same concept in different ways.

    prompts_ui.py lets you test prompts interactively using Streamlit with different styles & lengths.
